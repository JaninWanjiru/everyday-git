    <h1>Everyday Git</h1>
    <p>A beginner-friendly guide to using Git.</p>

    <!-- Main tile and blog intro -->
    <h2>1. Get Started</h2>
    <p><>Set up your development environment and create all the necessary files and folders.</p>
    <p><>To start writing HTML, all you need is a code editor (Visual Studio- Recommended) and a web browser (Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome).</p>

    <!-- Explains what Git is -->
    <h2>2. What is Git?</h2>
    <p><>Git is a <i><strong>Version Control System (VCS).</strong></i></p>
    <p><>A version control system is a software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.</p>
    <p><>Version Control Systems allow users to revisit earlier versions of their files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a lot more.</p>
    <p><>Other version control software include: Subversion, CVS, Mercurial.</p>
    <p><>They all have a common goal but vary significantly in how they achieve these goals.</p>
    <p><><strong><em>In this blog we will be going through Git and GitHub.</em></strong></p>

    <h3><i><u>What is GitHub</u></i></h3>
    <p><>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration tools for software development.</p>
    <p><>It allows developers to host, review, and manage code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.</p>
    <p><>GitHub is built around Git, making it easier for teams to work together and maintain a history of their codebase.</p>

    <!-- Explains the steps of installing git -->
     <h2>3. Installing Git</h2>
     <p><>To use Git, we need to first download and install it.</p>
     <p><>To download Git, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Visit Git</a> and download the version for your platform whether it is macOS or Windows or Linux.</p>
     <p><>Run the downloaded installer, leave all the default options during installation.</p>
     <p><><strong>To confirm whether Git was installed successfully:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt in windows or terminal in mac/linux.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git --version</mark></li>
            <li>If a version number is returned, Git is installed on your system. If you receive any other output, Git is not installed.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- Explains how to configure git -->
     <h2>4. Configuring Git</h2>
     <p><>Now that Git is installed, it's time to configure basic information.</p>
     <p><>We don't need to 'register an account' to use Git, however, we need to tell Git who we are. By providing our username and email address.</p>

     <p><Strong>Configuring your username:</Strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt or terminal depending on your platform.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git config --global user.name "USERNAME"</mark></p>[Replace USERNAME with your preferred username, for example, if your username is JaninWanjiru- you'll write: <em><strong>git config --global user.name "JaninWanjiru"</em></strong>]</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

     <p><Strong>Configuring your email address:</Strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt or terminal depending on your platform.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git config --global user.email "EMAIL_ADDRESS"</mark></p> [Replace EMAIL_ADDRESS with your email address, for example, if your email address is janinndongo02@gmail.com- you'll write: <em><strong>git config --global user.email "janinndongo02@gmail.com"</strong></em>]</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Explains the steps of initializing a git repo -->
     <h2>5. Intializing a Git repository</h2>
     <h3><i><u>What is a Git Repository</u></i></h3>
     <p><>A git repo is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.</p>
     <p><>Anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, et.c, we need to create a new git repository.</p>
     <p><>We can have as many repos as we want on our machine all with separate history and content, however, it is important to note that a project should have a single Git repository.</p>
     <p><strong>To initialize a git repository:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the terminal or command prompt in your project directory, you can also open your command line tool and navigate to your project directory.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git init</mark></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
     <p><b>NOTE:</b> Initializing a git repository is something you do once per project. Running the command <i><strong>git init</strong></i> in a project that contains a git repository will make git initialize a repository within a repository.</p>
     <p><b>Tip:</b> use <i><strong>git status</strong></i> to confirm whether your project has a git repository or not.</p>
     <p><>When you run the git status command and get the message "fatal: not a git repository..." being returned, then it means that the project does not have a git repository, you can go ahead and initialize one.</p>
     <p><>If you get anything else back, then it means that the current directory contains a git repository, therefore no need to initialize one again.</p>

     <!-- Explains the steps of adding files to the staging area -->
      <h2>6. Adding files to the staging area</h2>
      <p><>In Git, the <i><strong>staging area</strong></i> also known as the <i>index</i> is an intermediate space where you can organize changes before committing them to the repository.</p>
      <p><>When you make changes to files in your working directory, you need to add these changes to the staging area using the <i><strong>git add</strong></i> command.
        <ul>
            <li>To add changes, run the command <mark>git add .</mark> to add all the files in one go.</li>
            <li>Or the command <i><b>git add FILE_NAME</b></i> to add a single file.</li>
        </ul>
     </p>
      
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/Add.png" alt="Adding Files">
        <figcaption>Using <b><i>git add .</i></b> command to add all files to the staging area.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3><i><u>Tracked vs Untracked Files</u></i></h3>
      <p><>When you use Git, your files fall into two main categories: tracked and untracked. Understanding the difference helps you know what Git is actually monitoring.</p>
      <p><b>Untracked Files</b></p>
      <p><>These are files that Git sees in your working directory but hasn't been told to track yet. They:
        <ul>
            <li>Haven't been added using git add</li>
            <li>Won't be included in commits until you explicitly track them.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <figure>
        <img src="./images/untracked.png" alt="Untracked files" height="160px">
        <figcaption>Using <i><strong>git status</strong></i> command to view Untracked files.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Tracked Files</b></p>
      <p><>These are files that Git already knows about. They were either:
        <ul>
            <li>part of the initial commit</li>
            <li>staged using git add</li>
            <li>or committed before.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <p>Tracked files can be in one of three states:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unmodified:</b> Nothing has changed since the last commit.</li>
            <li><b>Modified:</b> The file has been changed but not yet staged.</li>
            <li><b>Staged:</b> The file is marked to be included in the next commit.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <figure>

      <!-- Explains the steps of commiting changes -->
       <h2>7. Commiting changes</h2>
       <p><>A commit in git is a checkpoint in time, it is a snapshot of changes in your repository.</p>
       <p><>The commit process involves recording snapshots of your project at various stages, allowing you to track progress, revert changes and collaborate with others efficiently.</p>
       <p><>Committing will only work if there are changes in the staging area.</p>
       <p>Key components of a commit:
        <ul>
            <li><b>A hash:</b> a unique identifier for each commit.</li>
            <li><b>Commit message:</b> a descriptive message that explains the purpose of the commit.</li>
            <li><b>Author:</b> the person who made the commit.</li>
            <li><b>Timestamp:</b> the date and time when the commit was made.</li>
        </ul>
       </p>
       <p><>To commit, we use the <i><strong>git commit</strong></i> command.</p>
       <p><>There is a <mark>-m</mark> flag that allows us to pass a commit message directly without having to open a text editor.</p>
       <p><><mark>git commit -m "MESSAGE"</mark>, Replace MESSAGE with a short descriptive commit message of your choosing.</p>
       <figure>
        <img src="./images/initial commit.png" alt="Initial commit">
        <figcaption>The initial commit of the project using <i><strong>git commit -m "MESSAGE"</strong></i> command</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <h3><i><u>How to view past commits</u></i></h3>
       <p><>To view past commits, we use the command: <mark>git log</mark></p>
       <figure>
        <img src="./images/past commit.png" alt="Past commit" height="150px">
        <figcaption>Viewing past commits using <i><b>git log</b></i> command.</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <p><>To view past commits in a summarized format, we pass the flag --oneline to the git log command; <mark>git log --oneline</mark></p>
       <figure>
        <img src="./images/past commit summarized.png" alt="Past commit summarized">
        <figcaption>Viewing past commits using <i><b>git log --oneline</b></i> command.</figcaption>
       </figure>

       <h3><i><u>How to go back to a particular commit</u></i></h3>
       <p><>To look around or test something in a previous commit, we use the command: <mark>git checkout [commit-hash]</mark></p>
       <p><>To find a commit hash, we use the command explained earlier <i><b>git log</b></i>, then copy the first few characters of the commit hash to use in your command.</p>

       <!-- Explains the definition of Branch -->
        <h2>8. Branches</h2>
        <p><>A <strong>branch</strong> in Git is like a separate line of development that allows you to work on different versions of a project independently.</p>
        <p><>Think of it as a workspace where you can make changes, test new features, or fix bugs without affecting the main version of your code.</p>
        <p>Importance of Branches:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safe experimentation:</strong> You can try out new ideas without breaking the main codebase.</li>
                <li><strong>Parallel development:</strong> Multiple team members can work on different features simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Better organization:</strong> You can manage tasks or features branches before combining them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><i><u><b>The master branch</b></u></i></p>
        <p><>This is the default git branch.</p>
        <p><>It doesn't do anything special or have any fancy powers, it's just like any other branches.</p>
        <p><i><u><b>What is HEAD?</b></u></i></p>
        <P><>While working with git, often times you will come across something like (HEAD -> master).</P>
        <P><><strong>HEAD</strong> is simply a pointer that refers to the current "location" in your repository.</P>
        <p><>At any given time in git, only one branch can be active. HEAD points to this branch.</p>

        <!-- Explains the steps of creating a branch -->
         <h2>9. Creating a branch</h2>
         <p><>To create a branch, we use the command: <mark>git branch BRANCH_NAME</mark></p>
         <p><>Replace BRANCH_NAME with your preferred branch name, for example, if we want to create a branch called production: <i><b>git branch production</b></i></p>
         <figure>
            <img src="./images/branch creation.png" alt="Creating a branch">
            <figcaption>Creating a branch named production using <i>git branch BRANCH_NAME</i> command.</figcaption>
         </figure>

         <!-- Explains how to view all branches that have been created -->
          <h2>10. Viewing all branches</h2>
          <p><>Use the command <i><strong>git branch</strong></i> to view your existing branches.</p>
          <p><>The active branch will have a little asterisk symbol (*) beside it and in some command line interfaces will be green in color.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="./images/branch view.png" alt="Viewing branches">
            <figcaption>Viewing all the branches that were created using <i><strong>git branch</strong></i> command.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <!-- Explains how to switch active branches -->
           <h2>11. Switching active branches</h2>
           <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is always important to stage and commit changes before switching branches.</p>
           <p><>Switching branches means changing the active branch.</p>
           <p><>To switch branches, we use the command: <mark>git switch BRANCH_NAME</mark></p>
           <p><>Replace BRANCH_NAME with the name of the branch, for example, if we want to make production the active branch (switching to it): <i><b>git switch production</b></i></p>
           <figure>
            <img src="./images/branch switch.png" alt="Switching to a differnt branch ">
            <figcaption>Switching to a banch named production using <i><strong>git switch production</strong></i> command and confirming using <i><strong>git branch</strong></i> command.</figcaption>
