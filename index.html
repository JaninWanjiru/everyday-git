    <h1>Everyday Git</h1>
    <p>A beginner-friendly guide to using Git.</p>

    <!-- Step 1 -->
    <h2>1. Get Started</h2>
    <p>Set up your development environment and create all the necessary files and folders.</p>
    <p>To start writing HTML, all you need is a code editor (Visual Studio- Recommended) and a web browser (Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome).</p>

    <!-- Step 2 -->
    <h2>2. What is Git?</h2>
    <p>Git is a <i><strong>Version Control System (VCS).</strong></i></p>
    <p>A version control system is a software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.</p>
    <p>Version Control Systems allow users to revisit earlier versions of their files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a lot more.</p>
    <p>Other version control software include: Subversion, CVS, Mercurial.</p>
    <p>They all have a common goal but vary significantly in how they achieve these goals.</p>
    <p><strong><em>In this blog we will be going through Git and GitHub.</em></strong></p>

    <h3><i><u>What is GitHub</u></i></h3>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration tools for software development.</p>
    <p>It allows developers to host, review, and manage code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.</p>
    <p>GitHub is built around Git, making it easier for teams to work together and maintain a history of their codebase.</p>

    <!-- Step 3 -->
     <h2>3. Installing Git</h2>
     <p>To use Git, we need to first download and install it.</p>
     <p>To download Git, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Visit Git</a> and download the version for your platform whether it is macOS or Windows or Linux.</p>
     <p>Run the downloaded installer, leave all the default options during installation.</p>
     <p><strong>To confirm whether Git was installed successfully:</strong></p>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt in windows or terminal in mac/linux.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git --version</mark></li>
            <li>If a version number is returned, Git is installed on your system. If you receive any other output, Git is not installed.</li>
        </ul>
     </p>

    </figure>

    <!-- Step 4 -->
     <h2>4. Configuring Git</h2>
     <p>Now that Git is installed, it's time to configure basic information.</p>
     <p>We don't need to 'register an account' to use Git, however, we need to tell Git who we are. By providing our username and email address.</p>

     <p><Strong>Configuring your username</Strong></p>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt or terminal depending on your platform.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git config --global user.name "USERNAME"</mark></p>[Replace USERNAME with your preferred username, for example, if your username is JaninWanjiru- you'll write: <em><strong>git config --global user.name "JaninWanjiru"</em></strong>]</li>
        </ul>
     </p>

     <p><Strong>Configuring your email address</Strong></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open command prompt or terminal depending on your platform.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git config --global user.email "EMAIL_ADDRESS"</mark></p> [Replace EMAIL_ADDRESS with your email address, for example, if your email address is janinndongo02@gmail.com- you'll write: <em><strong>git config --global user.email "janinndongo02@gmail.com"</strong></em>]</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- Step 5 -->
     <h2>5. Intializing a Git repository</h2>
     <h3><i><u>What is a Git Repository</u></i></h3>
     <p>A git repo is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.</p>
     <p>Anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, et.c, we need to create a new git repository.</p>
     <p>We can have as many repos as we want on our machine all with separate history and content, however, it is important to note that a project should have a single Git repository.</p>
     <p><strong>To initialize a git repository:</strong></p>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the terminal or command prompt in your project directory, you can also open your command line tool and navigate to your project directory.</li>
            <li>Run the command: <mark>git init</mark></li>
        </ul>
     </p>
    
     <p><b>NOTE:</b> Initializing a git repository is something you do once per project. Running the command <i><strong>git init</strong></i> in a project that contains a git repository will make git initialize a repository within a repository.</p>
     <p><b>Tip:</b> use <i><strong>git status</strong></i> to confirm whether your project has a git repository or not.</p>
     <p><>When you run the git status command and get the message "fatal: not a git repository..." being returned, then it means that the project does not have a git repository, you can go ahead and initialize one.</p>
     <p><>If you get anything else back, then it means that the current directory contains a git repository, therefore no need to initialize one again.</p>

     <!-- Step 6 -->
      <h2>6. Adding files to the staging area</h2>
      <p>In Git, the <i><strong>staging area</strong></i> also known as the <i>index</i> is an intermediate space where you can organize changes before committing them to the repository.</p>
      <p>When you make changes to files in your working directory, you need to add these changes to the staging area using the <i><strong>git add</strong></i> command.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>To add changes, run the command <mark>git add .</mark> to add all the files in one go.</li>
            <li>Or the command <i><b>git add FILE_NAME</b></i> to add a single file.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./Add.png" alt="Adding Files">
        <figcaption>Using <b><i>git add .</i></b> command to add all files to the staging area.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3><i><u>Tracked vs Untracked Files</u></i></h3>
      <p>When you use Git, your files fall into two main categories: tracked and untracked. Understanding the difference helps you know what Git is actually monitoring.</p>
      <p><b>Untracked Files</b></p>
      <p>These are files that Git sees in your working directory but hasn't been told to track yet. They:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Haven't been added using git add</li>
            <li>Won't be included in commits until you explicitly track them.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./untracked.png" alt="Untracked files" height="170px">
        <figcaption>Using <i>git status</i> to view Untracked Files.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Tracked Files</b></p>
      <p>These are files that Git already knows about. They were either:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>part of the initial commit</li>
            <li>staged using git add</li>
            <li>or committed before.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Tracked files can be in one of three states:</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Unmodified:</b> Nothing has changed since the last commit.</li>
            <li><b>Modified:</b> The file has been changed but not yet staged.</li>
            <li><b>Staged:</b> The file is marked to be included in the next commit.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
